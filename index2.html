    <h2>A little about me"</h2>
    <p>Hello im Nicolas Aguirre im 18 years old currently trying to study to be a software engineer but im going to college soon, well everything about coding really cayght my attention i remmeber taking my first computer science class and it really caught my attention because i had to vreate an app and it was interesting because ive never done it before and i think im the first member of my family who created an app before, anyways even though sometime computer science it was kind of hard sometimes i would gave up sometimes,but now ive decided to study and finish a course that i bought on udemy and then finish it so that i can have more knowledge about programing before i go to college so that i can be on step ahead.</p>
